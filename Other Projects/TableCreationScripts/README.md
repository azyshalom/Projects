Subject: Creating tables

I don’t know if anyone else would use this, but if you want to give this out…

This tool will help you create the scripts to build tables, audit tables for those tables, the triggers to write to the audit tables, and the associated views.
It puts the files in the ChangeScripts folder on your repository in the right upgrade|rollback/database folder and orders them based on what you would usually expect.

We’ve been using it in ClientInterfaces for a while now, but I just updated it to fit the new Atlas ChangeScripts scheme

The source code for now is here: http://sourcecontrol/svn/Gis/Development/DevelopersCorner/ClientInterfaces/MiscTools/TableCreationScripts
