<h1>ShellExecute CustomAction</h1>

<p>
The WixShellExec custom action in wixca (part of WixUtilExtension) lets you open document or URL targets via the Windows shell.
A common use is to launch readme files or URLs using their registered default applications based on their extension.
Note that WixShellExecute can only be used as an immediate custom action as it launches an application without waiting for it to close.
WixShellExec reads its target from the WixShellExecTarget property, formats it, and then calls ShellExecute with the formatted value.
It uses the default verb, which is usually "open." For more information, see <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/library/en-us/shellcc/platform/shell/reference/functions/shellexecute.asp">ShellExecute Function</a>.
</p>

<p>
Here's how you could use WixShellExecute to launch a readme file based on its File/@Id attribute value using WixUI's support for adding a checkbox to the final dialog:
</p>

<pre>
&lt;CustomAction Id="LaunchReadme" BinaryKey="WixCA" DllEntry="WixShellExec" Execute="immediate" Return="check" Impersonate="yes" /&gt;
&lt;Property Id="WIXUI_EXITDIALOGOPTIONALCHECKBOXTEXT" Value="Open readme" /&gt;
&lt;Property Id="WixShellExecTarget" Value="[#readme]" /&gt;
&lt;UI&gt;
    &lt;UIRef Id="WixUI_Minimal" /&gt;
    &lt;Publish Dialog="ExitDialog" Control="Finish" Event="DoAction" Value="LaunchReadme" Order="1"&gt;NOT Installed&lt;/Publish&gt;
&lt;/UI&gt;
</pre>

<p>
If you want to run more than one command line in the immediate sequence then you need to schedule WixShellExecute 
multiple times and set the WixShellExecuteTarget property (using a type 51 custom action) right before you want 
each of them executed.
